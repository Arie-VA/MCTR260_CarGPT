# MCTR_260_CarGPT, AI Enhanced Control System Project



## Overview
This project integrates a standard MCTR second-year simulated warehouse engineering project with AI-driven decision-making. 

Developed as part of a University of Alberta Engineering course this collaborative robotics project is designed to explore intelligent behaviour, task planning, and motion control in a simulated warehouse enviroment. Our robot will nagivate a predetermined enviroment and will identify small objects such as boxes and balls, delivering them to designated dropoff zones sorted by colour.
